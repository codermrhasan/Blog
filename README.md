# Dev Stack At A Glance

Software development at a glance. The main purpose of this repo is review a topic as short as possible. Remember this guide is best suited for python stack.    
  
[N.B: _It's highly recommended that to be a master of any skills you have to read and practice more and more outside of these tiny tutorials. But of course it will be a good place to get bird's eye view of a topic._]
